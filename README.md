## Top Features

	
1. Imports Three Major MLS API Feeds Into Custom WordPress Post-Type 
    1. Compatible MLS API Feeds - Boat Wizard, IYBA, and/or Yatco
    2. Since we import data, we don't rely on constant API connections to deliver search and detail pages. Meaning fewer outages for users. 
    3. Fail Safes And Alerts
        1. If a sync fails, the past data stays up, and you are also alerted as to why the sync failed. 
        2. If a sync is “successful” / false positive and the number of vessels drops below the allowed amount, you will be alerted. 
    4. Can run imports for multiple API tokens!
        3. Got two boat wizard API keys, no problem!
        4. Got IYBA and Boat Wizard API keys, no problem.  \
We merge the data via hull IDs  \

2. Fast and feature-packed yacht search pages
    1. Multi-Select Filtering
    2. Mobile-friendly Search Overlay 
    2. Amazing Keyword Search 
    4. 300-500ms Return For Results 

3. Clean URLs for detail and search pages 
    1. An example of this in detail pages is no ID needed 
    2. An example of this search would look like this /search/condition-used/brand-viking/ \

4. Using AI Generate to generate unique text points for metadata and short content
    1. For Example - Yacht Detail Pages Meta Descriptions From Context Of MLS Data
    2. For Example - Headings And Paragraphs about search results with backlinks to blog posts. \
